Though Python has its own way to evaluate an expression behind the scene, the results of
a Python expression and its corresponding arithmetic expression are the same. Therefore,
you can safely apply the arithmetic rules for evaluating a Python expression. Operators
contained within pairs of parentheses are evaluated first. Parentheses can be nested, in which
case the expression in the inner parentheses is evaluated first. When more than one operator
is used in an expression, the following operator precedence rule is used to determine the
order of evaluation.
